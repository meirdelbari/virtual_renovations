General Instructions
--------------------

1. Architecture & Code Organization
   - Each feature (button or UI module) must be implemented as an independent, self-contained component.
   - Avoid generating code scripts over 400 lines in a single file. If a feature requires more code, split it into several smaller, focused files or blocks.
   - Features are loaded via `main.js` which initializes global entry points (e.g., `window.initFeatureName`).

2. User Workflow Modes
   - **Option A (Floor Plan First):** Users upload a JSON/PDF floor plan, then upload photos and link them to specific rooms. Best for full projects.
   - **Option B (Photos Only):** Users skip floor plans, upload photos directly, and tag them with room types (e.g., "Living Room"). Best for quick visualizations.

3. AI Features
   - **Renovate:** Changes materials (floors, walls, kitchen cabinets) based on a selected Style.
   - **Furniture:**
     - *Remove:* Clears the room to an empty shell.
     - *Stage:* Adds furniture to an empty room based on the Style and Room Type.
   - **AlgoreitAI:** The "✨ AlgoreitAI" button triggers the generation process using the selected options.

4. Testing & Verification
   - Always verify that new features work in both Option A and Option B modes.
   - Ensure UI elements (dropdowns, modals) are positioned correctly and have high z-index to appear above overlays.
